# Skill: Protocol for One-Shot Delivery

## Purpose
Run software work end to end through this fixed flow: doc-write, implementation, test, push/publication, and relay into the next implementable task.

This is the base one-shot delivery relay protocol. It is not time-limited by itself: when a cycle finishes and the user asked to keep going, continue in one-go, or complete remaining work, do not stop at TODO analysis. Select the next highest-value remaining task and immediately continue through doc-write, implementation, test, push/publication, and relay again.

`$릴레이샷` is the default time-unlimited relay skill. `$스케줄릴레이샷` is the separate time-limited relay gate. Use schedule relay only when the user provided a work-until time, stop time, deadline, or session end time.

## Usage
Execute this protocol when the user asks for "원샷딜", "원샷오케", "원샷딜리버리", "한번에 끝까지", "one-shot delivery", or asks to complete requirements, implementation, tests, and push without stopping early.

## Required Flow Form

At the beginning of every one-shot cycle, create a visible flow form and use it as the execution ledger.
Do this before implementation so the relay, push, validation, and repair phases are not forgotten.

1 Doc / Contract: IN_PROGRESS
2 Implementation: TODO
3 Validation: TODO
4 Repair Loop: TODO
5 Push / Publication: TODO
6 Relay Shot: TODO
7 Final Ledger: TODO
```

Rules:

- If a cycle was launched by `$릴레이샷`, the selected next TODO becomes the `요청 범위`.
- Do not skip the form just because the work appears small; mark irrelevant phases `SKIPPED_WITH_REASON`.
- If code edits have already started before the form exists, create the form immediately and continue from the actual current state.
- At final response time, the form should have terminal statuses or a clear blocker.

## Downstream Skills

- `$doc-contract-writer`
- `$one-go` for implementation
- `$test-runner`
- `$릴레이샷` as the default final relay after push
- `$스케줄릴레이샷` only when the user provided a work-until time, used as the time gate before launching another full implementation cycle

## Terminal States

Every phase must end as one of:

- `COMPLETED`
- `BLOCKED`
- `FAILED_AFTER_RETRY`
- `SKIPPED_WITH_REASON`

Do not produce a final delivery report while any phase is only `TODO`, `NEXT`, `REMAINING`, or `FUTURE WORK`.

## Protocol Steps

1. **Scope Intake**
   - Parse the user request, target repository, branch, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
   - Build a delivery ledger with phases, status, owner, evidence, and open risks.
   - The initial plan must include this flow explicitly: `$doc-contract-writer` -> `$one-go` -> `$test-runner` -> push/publication -> `$릴레이샷` or `$스케줄릴레이샷`.
   - If this cycle was launched by a relay, treat the selected remaining TODO as the new concrete delivery scope.

2. **Documentation / Contract Phase**
   - Use `$doc-contract-writer`.
   - Produce or verify requirements, assumptions, contracts, acceptance criteria, implementation batches, and test plan.
   - Mark the phase `COMPLETED`, `BLOCKED`, or `SKIPPED_WITH_REASON`.

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Use `$one-go` by default.
   - Execute implementation until the selected scope reaches a terminal state.
   - Use `$batch-sequential-runner` only when the work has already been decomposed into explicit batches or the user asked for batch execution.
   - Run targeted checks during implementation when useful.

4. **Validation Phase**
   - Use `$test-runner`.
   - Run automated checks and actual behavior validation.
   - For UI/user-facing work, reproduce the user's real actions with Playwright, browser-use, screenshots, or Computer Use when available.
   - Produce a verdict: `PASS`, `PASS_WITH_RISKS`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED`.

5. **Repair Loop**
   - If validation fails and the failure is fixable within scope, create a focused repair batch.
   - Use `$batch-sequential-runner` for the repair, then rerun `$test-runner`.
   - Stop after two unsuccessful repair attempts on the same failure unless the user explicitly asks to continue.
   - Mark persistent failures `FAILED_AFTER_RETRY` or `BLOCKED` with evidence.

6. **Push / Publication Phase**
   - Run after validation and repair/retest handling.
   - If the task has a repository, branch, PR, deployment branch, or user-requested publication target, push after tests complete.
   - If there is no push target or no git changes, mark `SKIPPED_WITH_REASON`.
   - If push is unsafe or impossible, mark `BLOCKED` with exact reason.
   - Do not include unrelated user changes in a commit or push.
   - Record branch, remote, commit, and PR/deployment URL when available.

7. **Base Relay Phase**
   - If the user asked to continue, keep going, finish remaining TODOs, run in one-go, or otherwise implied an open-ended relay, analyze remaining TODOs after push/publication handling.
   - Use `$릴레이샷`.
   - Choose the highest-value next task that can be safely started.
   - Start the next task immediately as a new full one-shot cycle: scope intake, documentation/contract if needed, implementation, validation, repair, and push/publication.
   - Do not return only a plan for the next task unless the next task is unsafe, blocked, too ambiguous, or outside the requested scope.
   - If the user provided a work-until time, stop time, deadline, or session end time, invoke `$스케줄릴레이샷` instead of using this open-ended base relay.

8. **Relay Loop Guard**
   - Continue base relay cycles while all are true:
     - the user intent allows continuing
     - the previous push/publication phase is `COMPLETED` or safely `SKIPPED_WITH_REASON`
     - a concrete remaining TODO exists
     - the next task can be completed or advanced safely without creating half-finished risky changes
   - Stop the base relay when no valuable TODO remains, the next task is unsafe, blocked, ambiguous, outside scope, or the user requested a stop.
   - For time-limited stopping, hand control to `$스케줄릴레이샷`.
   - When stopping, record why the relay stopped and what the next concrete task would be.

9. **Final Integration Review**
   - Confirm each phase has a terminal state.
   - Summarize commands run, validation evidence, push/publication result, schedule relay result, remaining risks, and files changed.
   - If any phase is blocked or failed after retry, state the next concrete unblock step.

## Push Safety

Before pushing:

- inspect `git status`
- identify intended files only
- avoid staging unrelated user changes
- verify branch and remote
- use project-specific PR/release workflow when present
- report when push is skipped or blocked

## Output Contract

Final report must include:

- phase status ledger
- tests and validation performed
- push/publication outcome
- relay outcome, including whether another implementation cycle was launched
- schedule relay outcome only when a time-limited relay was requested
- residual risks or blockers
- next required human action, if any
